 # HieraKGTNet
A Python program to do deep learning experiments on several hyperspectral datasets.

# Requirements
Python 2.7 and Python 3.5+ are compatible with this utility.
The PyTorch deep learning and GPU computing framework serves as its foundation.

# Setup
Installing dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt and setting up a Python virtual environment are the simplest ways to install this code.
!pip install patchify visdom timm torchinfo
